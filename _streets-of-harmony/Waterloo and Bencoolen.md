Also known as the Wadda Gurdwara, this Sikh temple was the first set up in a bungalow at Queen Street in 1912. The temple is now relocated at Towner Road.
This was one of the earliest gurdwaras (Sikh temple) to be built in Singapore - the first being erected within the police compound at Pearl's Hill, which had served the spiritual needs of the Sikh police contingent. With the arrival of the immigrants in other professions, the Sikh Temple at the police barracks became inadequate for the community's needs. In 1912, a group of Sikhs, led by a Sindhi merchant called Wassiamull, acquired a bungalow at 175 Queen Street and turned this into a gurdwara. This not only catered to the spiritual needs of Sikhs, but also became the focus of social activity for the Sikh community.
