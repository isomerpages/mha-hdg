  Ayer was designated a Chinese district by Stamford Raffles in 1822 and gained
  prominence in the 1820s because it served as the landing site for early
  immigrants. This led to a concentration of religious buildings and Chinese
  clan associations along the street. The street thus gives a useful insight
  into the life of early Chinese immigrants.

Telok Ayer Street extends from [Market Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_351_2005-01-11.html) to [Anson Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_348_2004-12-17.htm). Telok Ayer was designated a Chinese district by [Stamford Raffles](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) in 1822 and gained prominence in the 1820s because it served as the landing site for early immigrants. This led to a concentration of religious buildings and Chinese clan associations along the street. The street thus gives a useful insight into the life of early Chinese immigrants.

**History**  
![Telok Ayer Street](/images/Telok%20Ayer%20Street.jpg)
Telok Ayer Street used to face the original seafront and served as docking bay for the boats and&nbsp;[_sampans_](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_958_2005-01-06.html)&nbsp;of early immigrants.&nbsp;Grateful for a safe journey, many set up altars and worship houses to give thanks to their gods.&nbsp;

Indian Muslims who had survived the perilous journey from south India built the&nbsp;[Al-Abrar Mosque](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_519_2004-12-24.html)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;[Nagore Durgha Shrine](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_536_2004-12-27.html)&nbsp;along the street. The&nbsp;[Hakkas](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1497_2009-04-09.html)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Cantonese](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1491_2009-03-25.html)&nbsp;built the&nbsp;[Fuk Tak Chi Temple](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_232_2004-12-10.html), dedicated to the earth god, Dak Bak Gong,&nbsp;also known as Tua Peh Kong.&nbsp;The&nbsp;[Hokkiens](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1498_2009-04-09.html)&nbsp;set up a simple shrine in 1819, dedicated to the Goddess of the Sea, Ma-Zu-Po (Tian Shang Sheng Mu), the Mother of Heavenly Sages, the Heavenly Holy Mother, the Celestial Queen, in gratitude for their safe arrival from China. The&nbsp;[Thian Hock Keng Temple](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_793_2005-01-10.html)&nbsp;(Temple of Heavenly Happiness) eventually grew out of this shrine in 1842 and houses shrines to several Chinese deities.  
  
Chinese immigrants from China congregated in the area (including at nearby&nbsp;[Smith Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_681_2005-01-25.html)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Amoy Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_347_2004-12-24.html)), particularly the Hokkiens from Fujian province, and it became a bustling business centre.&nbsp;The&nbsp;[Hokkien Huay Kuan](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-04-07_163620.html)&nbsp;and the Ying Fo Fui Kun, a Hakka Association Hall, were also established here.&nbsp;Many led difficult lives as the area was rife with slave trade, with many Chinese immigrants serving as slave labour.&nbsp;A big fire also occurred in the area in 1891.&nbsp;Around the turn of the century, due to rising pollution and congestion, merchants who had started businesses in this area moved out to more conducive and pleasant surroundings.  
  
**Description**  
Reclamation of the Telok Ayer Bay in 1887 created the land on which&nbsp;[Cecil Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1435_2009-12-10.html)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Robinson Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_179_2005-01-19.html)&nbsp;now stand, and reclamation of the Telok Ayer Basin in the early 1900s created the area now known as&nbsp;[Shenton Way](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_726_2005-01-25.html).&nbsp;These developments pushed Telok Ayer Street four streets further away from the seafront.  
  
Pre-war houses can be found along Telok Ayer Street, with neighbouring&nbsp;[McCallum Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_979_2005-09-02.html)&nbsp;containing old buildings of great historical interest, such as the Thian Hock Keng Temple, the Fuk Tak Chi Temple, the Ying Fo Fui Kun Hakka Association Hall, the Hock Teck Ch’i Temple, the Nagore Durgha Shrine, the Al-Abrar Mosque and the&nbsp;[Chinese Methodist Church](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1377_2009-11-26.html).
