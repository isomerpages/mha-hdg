title: Telok Ayer & Amoy Streets
permalink: /streets-of-harmony/telok-aye-amoy-streets/
description: Telok Ayer Street extends from Market Street to Anson Road. Telok
  Ayer was designated a Chinese district by Stamford Raffles in 1822 and gained
  prominence in the 1820s because it served as the landing site for early
  immigrants. This led to a concentration of religious buildings and Chinese
  clan associations along the street. The street thus gives a useful insight
  into the life of early Chinese immigrants.
