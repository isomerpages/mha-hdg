![GALLERY TWO: SEEKING WHAT IS COMMON](/images/G2_1.jpg)

This gallery explores the threads of commonality woven into Singapore's rich religious tapestry. Visitors learn how our faith communities have contributed to Singapore's development in the common spirit of doing good and how each religion's cherished values and practices are shared and similarly expressed across other faiths. Recognising the importance of finding and emphasising common ground is a key step to fostering mutual understanding and respect.

There have been occasions when our social cohesion and harmony have been tested. This gallery examines the dangers of accentuated religious differences and a lack of interfaith understanding. A multimedia exhibit brings the Maria Hertogh Riots to life, highlighting the causes and lessons of the riots.

Will we let our differences divide us or our commonalities unite us?
