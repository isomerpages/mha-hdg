![GALLERY THREE: MANY FAITHS, ONE PEOPLE](/images/G3_1.jpg)

Singapore's common spaces - places where people of different races and faiths interact and create shared experiences - are a central building block of religious peace and harmony. Here, diverse places of worship coexist peacefully and positive interfaith interactions are not uncommon. However, our high-density urban environment invariably creates friction. This gallery takes a look at some of our common spaces and considers what the state, the community and the individual can do to protect them.

|<div style=\"width: 150px;\">![Gallery 3 Highlights](/images/G3_highlights.jpg)</div>| **Be part of the picture:**  Take a photo with a trick eye mural of a local coffee shop, an important example of common space where Singaporeans of all races and creeds interact. <br /><br />**Take on a Role:** For every action, there is a reaction. Play a scenario-based game and find out how our responses to everyday situations can either contribute towards building bridges that connect or walls that divide. What choice will you make? |
