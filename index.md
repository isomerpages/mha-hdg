description: The Harmony in Diversity Gallery (HDG) was developed by the
  Ministry of Home Affairs in collaboration with community partners and
  organisations. The Gallery aims to promote an appreciation of Singapore's rich
  religious diversity. It hopes this will foster a spirit of give and take,
  mutual respect and understanding, necessary to nurture and strengthen the
  religious peace and harmony we enjoy today.
