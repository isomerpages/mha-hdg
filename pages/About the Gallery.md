The Harmony in Diversity Gallery (HDG) was developed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in collaboration with community partners and organisations. The Gallery aims to promote an appreciation of Singapore's rich religious diversity. It hopes this will foster a spirit of give and take, mutual respect and understanding, necessary to nurture and strengthen the religious peace and harmony we enjoy today.

The HDG comprises four galleries of exhibits, artefacts and interactive features. Through this immersive and engaging platform, we hope to demonstrate the centrality of religious harmony to Singapore's continued development, as well as the efforts required to build interfaith peace in a religiously diverse society.

Within Singapore's rich tapestry of faiths, threads of commonality are interwoven. The Gallery highlights the importance of seeking common ground to build mutual respect and appreciation for the beliefs of others, and the need to protect and expand our common spaces. Join us on this journey of discovery as we learn to embrace our diversity, appreciate our commonalities, and above all, celebrate our unique identity - one that recognises that we all have a part to play to protect this precious legacy.

Only then can harmony in diversity truly be possible.
